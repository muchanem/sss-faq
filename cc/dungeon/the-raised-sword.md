---------------------
Congratulations! You are now on the 6th level!
First, let's take a look at your goals.
``` 
Basic Syntax, Strings
```
```
Defeat the ogres.
Your hero must survive.
Bonus: no code problems.
Hint: Attack each ogre by name. Remember, each ogre takes two hits!
```
This level is relatively simple. Remember the ogres automaticly move
towards you so you don't even have to move.

###Bonus
<br>
Just remember to attack each ogre by name and to make sure you code
does not have any bugs and you have got this in the bag.
