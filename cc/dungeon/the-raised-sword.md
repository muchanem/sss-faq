---------------------
Congratulations! You are now on the 6th level!
First, let's take a look at your goals.
```
Defeat the ogres.
Your hero must survive.
Bonus: no code problems.
Hint: Attack each ogre by name. Remember, each ogre takes two hits!
```
This level is relatively simple. Remember the ogres automatically move
towards you so you don't even have to move.
<br>
**Hint**:use `self.attack("ogrename")` to attack them! Make sure to put `"`
around the names, because it is a name.

###Bonus
<br>
Defining things give one thing a value.
2 examples are:
`x = int(1 + 1)`
<br>
*int* means integer, or number.
<br>
`ogre = "Rig"`
<br>
`self.attack(ogre)`
<br>
