## Gems in the deep
<br>
#### CC Help >> Dungeon >> Gems in the deep
---------------------
This is the second level in the CodeCombat dungeon. Rely on your skills you
learned in the first level to complete it.
<br>
First, have a look at your goals:
`Collect the gems. Avoid the spikes.`
This tells you that you can't run into the walls, and have to pick up
all the gems. To complete this, use your `self.moveDirection()` commands.<br>
**HINT**:This will have 6-7 lines of code.
The 4 commands you should use are:
`self.moveRight()`, `self.moveUp()`,
`self.moveLeft()`, and `self.moveDown()`.
Now Try!
<br>
#### Bonus
<br>
To execute a move more than once, inside the parenthesis `()` put the number of moves you
want to make.<br>
For example, `self.moveUp(3)` really is
```
self.moveUp()
self.moveUp()
self.moveUp()
```
