## Known Enemy
<br>
#### CC Help >> Dungeon >> Known Enemy
---
In this level, they want you to define an enemy as a **variable**. For
example: `enemy1 = "Johnny"` |Whenever you use enemy1, it is the same
as if you used `"Johnny"`.  So you can `self.attack(enemy1)`.
<br>
**HINT**:If you define each name, you should have 9 lines of code,
because you need to attack each enemy twice.
<br>
#### Bonus
You can put more than one command on one line of code! Separate each
command with a `;`. For example:
<br>
```
enemy = "Bob" ; self.attack(enemy) ; self.attack(enemy)
```
Using this technique, you can fit all the code on *1* line!
