#### CC Help >> Dungeon >> Signs and Portents
--------
This level gives you a glimpse of what you might do in the future. For
now though, just use your `self.move()` methods.
**HINT** Use your numbers inside parens to repeat methods.
<br>
#### Bonus
Functions are like mini code blocks, that can be reused. Here is
an example: 
```
def function():
  self.moveUp()
  self.moveRight()
  ```
This is a function being called on:
`function()`
<br>
Calling on a function runs all the code within it.
<br>
<br>
Now you try!
<br>
<br>
First, see what code you have that can be repeated. In this case, you need to move
down then right. Define, or `def` a function that does this.
**NOTE**: functions*ALWAYS* come first in your code, otherwise, it is
run before it knows what it is!
<br>
<br>
***CHALLENGE***: Using your knowledge of functions and repeating
commands, complete the level using 7 lines of code!
