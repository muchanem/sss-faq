---------------------------------------

This level needs you to use a loop. Loops repeat code over and over.
<br>
When you use `while True`, you are telling the computer, while `True` is true, run the code in here.
This will work with any true statement whether it is `1 + 1 == 2` or
`1 == 1`, it will act the same way as if you used `True`. But don't
forget to put a colon after the statement (`True`) or it will give you
an error.
<br>
**Very Important Information:** To make sure your code runs underneath the loop, tab the
code over once (tab, the key above caps lock). You will only need 3 lines of code.
<br>
#### Quite Advanced Bonus
<br>
What if you only what to dodge the fireballs, say 10 times?
Use this in place of the `while True:` loop to run the code underneath 10 times!
```
i = 0
while i < 10:
  <code goes here>
  i += 1
```
**NOTE:** This is not the *best* way to do this (It still works), but the proper way is
in the mountain.
