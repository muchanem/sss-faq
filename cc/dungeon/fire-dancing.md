This level needs you to use a loop. Loops repeat code over and over.
<br>
`while True:`
is saying: if this condition is true, run this. Try replacing `while
True:` with `while 1+1==2:`. Since 1+1=2 is true, it will run the program.
<br>
**Hint**: To make sure your code runs underneath the loop, tab the
code over once. You will only need 3 lines of code.
<br>
#### Bonus
<br>
What if you only what to dodge the fireballs, say 10 times?
Use `for count in range(10):`in place of the `while True:` loop to run the code underneath 10 times!
