## Haunted Kithmaze
<br>
#### CC Help >> Dungeon >> Haunted Kithmaze
---
This level needs you to put `self.move` commands inside a `while
True:` loop. Make sure to indent!
**HINT**: This should take 5 or 3 lines of code.
<br>
#### Bonus
<br>
Complete the level using only **3** lines of code. Shortening code
makes it easier to understand.
