-----------------------------------------------
This is the first level you'll encounter. It is quite simple and
a great pathway into CodeCombat. In the top left, you'll see something
that should currently say `GOALS: Failed`. If you hover over it,
you'll see this pop up.
```
Avoid the spikes.
Collect the gem.
```
This means you can't walk into the walls (notice the spikes coming out),
and you have to collect the gem (blue crystal). On the right side,
you'll see the area to write your code. Right now you need to make
your character move to the right, down, and then right again.
To start it off, you need to call the method `moveRight()`. Since it
is a method in your class, it begins with `self`. To put it together,
it would look like `self.moveRight()`.

Now try!
**Hint:** It should use three lines.

#### Bonus
<br>
The `#` means anything following that is a comment. This code does
nothing and is ignored when running the program. **NOTICE:**
***ALWAYS*** read the comments. This will save *so* much time and
effort.
