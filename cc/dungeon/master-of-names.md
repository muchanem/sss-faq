First, by looking at the ogres, we can tell they *don't* have names.
This means we will have to attack them another way. We need to use
`self.findNearestEnemy()`. This will as stated, find the nearest
enemy. Then define each ogre as the nearest enemy. `ogre1
= self.findNearestEnemy()`. Attack each ogre twice, and you're all
set!
<br>
**HINT** This should take 9 lines of code.
<br>
#### Bonus
<br>
Instead of defining each enemy as self.findNearestEnemy, why not keep
defining them? Inside a `while True` loop, define `enemy
= self.findNearestEnemy()`. Then, if there is an enemy, attack it twice!
**BONUS HINT**: This should take 5 lines of code.
