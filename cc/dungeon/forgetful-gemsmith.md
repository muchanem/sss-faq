---------------------
Congratulations! You are now on the 4th level!
First, let's take a look at your goals.
```
Your hero must survive
Collect all 4 gems
Get to the exit
Bonus:No Code Problems
Bonus:Under 9 Code Statements
```
If something says bonus, it means that you don't need to complete it
to pass the level, but it will earn you extra gems if you do.
<br>
***ALWAYS***try to collect the bonus! You will need the gems in the
future. In this case, we need to shorten our code and have no mistypes.
If you have an error, you character will have a red x around him/her.
**HINT** remember to find the shortest possible path to collect the
gems. We are just using our `self.move()` methods.
<br>
#### Bonus
<br>
Remember to shorten your code, if possible.
`self.moveRight(2)` executes the command `self.moveRight()` twice.
***CHALLENGE***Complete the level with only **6** Code statements.
