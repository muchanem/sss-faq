## Integers and Decimals
<br>
#### Faq >> Python >> Integers and Decimals
----------
There are 3 forms of items in python. Integers, Floating point
(decimals), and Strings. 
<br>
---
**integers**:`number = int(something)` - The int transforms the
input into a integer. When printing an integer and something else, use
commas instead of plus signs.
<br>
`print("Your number is",number)`
<br>
---
**floating point**:  `decimal = float(something) - The float
transforms the input into a integer. Decimals also use commas.
<br>
`print("Your decimal is",decimal)`
<br>
---
**strings**: The default value is a string. Strings cannot be used in
calculations, and are just text. To convert something to a string, use 
`str(something)`
<br>
Strings are printed with `""` around the string, because it is a word.
