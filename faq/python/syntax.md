Many people will often have their program broken because of one simple
error. If your error message says this, you will find this article
helpful.

`SyntaxError`

In Python, every code block starts with a colon, then is indented four
spaces. Also, in if statements, you use `==` instead of `=`. Here is
an example.

<br>
```
if true == true:
    print("True!")
```
<br>

Following these rules can save a lot of time debugging for nothing.
**NOTE:** Python uses `elif` instead of `else if`.
