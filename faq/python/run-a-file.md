## How to run a Python program

#### FAQ >> Python >> Run a program
-----------------------------------

  Once you write your glorious bit of Python magic, you probably want
to run it. You do this by executing the following commands in the main
command line.

`chmod +x file`
This makes it so the computer knows to run it.
`file` or `./file`
This will actually run it.

`python3 file.py`

The difference is one file ends with a `.py`, and this is the only way
to run a file with `.py`. You can still use this if it doesn't end
with `.py`, but why would you want to type that all the time?
