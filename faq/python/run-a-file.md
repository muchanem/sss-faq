##How to run a Python program

  Once you write your glorious bit of Python magic, you probably want
to run it. You do this by executing the following commands in the main
command line.

`chmod u+x file`
`file` or `./file`

###OR

`python3 file.py`

The difference is one file ends with a `.py` and one doesn't, make
sure you do the right one.
