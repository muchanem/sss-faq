## Colors

#### FAQ >> Python >> Colors
----------------------------

After a while, the gray, default color may get boring. To get the text
colorful, you need to import a module. This is a simple task as done
below.

`import skilstak.colors as c`

This has now imported your colors module. You can use it like this.

`print(c.red + "Hello, World!")`

Some of you may know that there are simpler ways to use shortcuts.
These include using `c.r` instead of `c.red`. These are easy to do
use. All you have to do is type `colors`.
