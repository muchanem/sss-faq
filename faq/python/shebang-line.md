## Python Shebang Line
<br>
#### FAQ >> Python >> Shebang Line
----------------------------------

  The Python Shebang line is an incredibly important line for running
python files. This is an easy example.

`#!/usr/bin/env python3`

  This code should be at the top of your python program. Top meaning
line one. The Shebang line tells your program "Hey, this is Python,
lets run it as that."

  You also need to `chmod` this file. This then says "Hey, you should
try to run this."
