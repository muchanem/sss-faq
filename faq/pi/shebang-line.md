## Shell (and Bash) Shebang Line
<br>
#### FAQ >> Linux Pi >> Shell Shebang Line
----------------------------------

  The Shell Shebang line is an incredibly important line for running
bash files. This is an easy example.

`#!/bin/sh`

**Note:** You may be using Bash sometimes. This shebang line is not
much harder.

`#!/bin/bash`

This code should be at the top of your shell program. Top meaning
line one. The Shebang line tells your program "Hey, this is Shell,
lets run it as that."
You also need to `chmod` this file. This then says "Hey, you should
try to run this."
