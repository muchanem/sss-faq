Many people will often have their program broken because of one simple
error. If your error message says this, you will find this article
helpful.

`SyntaxError`

Now, in JavaScript, you should have `"use strict";` at the top of the
file to prevent you from doing some ridiculous errors. Also, as the
above code stated, everything should have a semicolon after it. Here
is an example: `var hi = "Hello, World!";`. In loops, you need
brackets to signal a code block. You also need your condition in
parenthesis. Here is another example.

<br>
```
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log("Hello, World");
}
```
<br>

Following these rules can save a lot of time debugging for nothing.
