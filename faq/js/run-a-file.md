#### FAQ >> JavaScript >> Run a program
-----------------------------------

  Once you write your glorious bit of JavaScript magic, you probably want

`chmod +x file`
This makes it so the computer knows to run it.
`file` or `./file`
This will actually run it.

`node file.js`

to run a file with `.js`. You can still use this if it doesn't end
with `.js`, but why would you want to type that all the time?
