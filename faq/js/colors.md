#### FAQ >> JavaScript >> Colors
----------------------------

After a while, the gray default color may get boring. To get the text
colorful, you need to import a module. This is a simple task as done
below.

`var c = require("skilstak-colors")`

This has now imported your colors module. You can use it like this.

`process.stdout.write(c.red + "Hello, World!")`
<br>
#### Bonus
<br>
Some of you may know that there are simpler ways to use shortcuts.
These include using `c.r` instead of `c.red`. These are easy to do
use. All you have to do is type `colors`.
**Note:** It will show the examples in python, but the variables are
named the same.
