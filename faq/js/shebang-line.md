## JavaScript Shebang Line
<br>
#### FAQ >> JavaScript >> Shebang Line
----------------------------------

  The JavaScript Shebang line is an incredibly important line for running
JavaScript files. This is an easy example.

`#!/usr/bin/env node`

You may be asking "Why is it 'node'?". This is because we use `node`
to run JavaScript from the command line. The reason behind this is
that JavaScript is usually in the web.
This code should be at the top of your JavaScript program. Top meaning
line one. The Shebang line tells your program "Hey, this is JavaScript,
lets run it as that."
You also need to `chmod` this file. This then says "Hey, you should
try to run this."
