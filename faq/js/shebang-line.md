## Node Shebang Line
<br>
#### FAQ >> JavaScript >> Shebang Line
----------------------------------

  The Node Shebang line is an incredibly important line for running
JavaScript files. This is an easy example.

`#!/usr/bin/env node`

  This code should be at the top of your JavaScript program. Top meaning
line one. The Shebang line tells your program "Hey, this is JavaScript,
lets run it as that."
  You also need to `chmod` this file. This then says "Hey, you should
try to run this."
